* Today i saw the simple past in my english class, i readed a text in past and i did activitys in past.
* In the class i learned some words that i didnÂ´t know, as: ate seafood, boat trip,sunbathed, made sandcastles.
* Too i ate vegetables and some chicken in the breakfast.
* I got the chicken yesterday because my grandmom gave me some chicken she cooked.
* I took my sport class and ate lunch, too i took a shower and now i do mi homework.
* i told you them about this, because that is i did today.
